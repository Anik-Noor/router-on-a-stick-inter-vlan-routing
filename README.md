# Router-on-a-Stick â€“ VLAN Trunking Lab (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This lab demonstrates how to implement **Router-on-a-Stick** using a single physical router interface to route traffic between multiple VLANs. The setup includes VLAN creation, trunking, and router subinterface configuration in Cisco Packet Tracer.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Objectives:
- Create VLAN 10 (Sales) and VLAN 20 (IT)
- Configure trunking between switch and router
- Assign PCs to VLANs with static IPs and gateways
- Use router subinterfaces to enable Inter-VLAN Routing
- Verify connectivity between devices in different VLANs

---

## ðŸ§± Topology:
- **1 x Router (1841 or similar)**  
- **1 x Layer 2 Switch (2960)**  
- **2 x PCs** (assigned to different VLANs)

---

## ðŸ’» IP Configuration:
- VLAN 10: `192.168.10.0/24`  
- VLAN 20: `192.168.20.0/24`  
- PC0: `192.168.10.1` â†’ Gateway: `192.168.10.100`  
- PC1: `192.168.20.1` â†’ Gateway: `192.168.20.100`
